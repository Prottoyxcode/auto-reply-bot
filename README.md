# auto-reply-bot

This is my second Mega-project.
<br>
This code is of a autoreplybot.At the moment it mainly works for English language.It is made with only free version modules..
<br>

File descriptions-
<br>
1.cusor_coordinates.py --> This script is used to find out co-ordinates of where the cursor is or go to a specific point.
<br>
2.final_replybot.py --> This is the main program. It contains the required code that can copy the texts on a screen, analyse them, generate a userlike response and send it in a browser. Co-ordinates might need to be adjusted if needed.
<br>

<br>
6.text1.txt and text2.txt -->I needed to find out the differences between these two as I couldn't find them while reading but felt like I repeated the same code. turned out I updated the code but forgot to remove the older one
